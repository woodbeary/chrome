# X/Twitter AI Response Generator Chrome Extension

## Project Overview
A Chrome extension that enhances X/Twitter with AI-powered response generation using Google's Gemini API. The extension injects "Generate" buttons on every post in the timeline, allowing quick AI-generated responses based on post context and historical performance data.

## Core Features

### 1. UI Integration
- Inject "Generate" button on every post in timeline
- Loading indicator while generating response
- Auto-insertion of generated text into reply field
- One-click posting after generation

### 2. Context Handling
- Extract post content including:
  - Main post text
  - Any media context (images, videos)
  - Parent thread context if available
  - Author information
  - Post engagement metrics

### 3. AI Generation
- Multi-shot prompting with Gemini API
- Context-aware response generation
- Learning from provided high-performing responses
- Optimization for engagement metrics

### 4. Performance Training
- Ability to input successful past responses
- Store engagement patterns and metrics
- Train the prompt to match successful response styles
- Optimize for:
  - Impressions
  - Likes
  - Retweets
  - Reply engagement

## Technical Architecture

### Components
1. **Content Script**
   - Timeline post detection
   - Button injection
   - Context extraction
   - Response insertion

2. **Background Service**
   - Gemini API communication
   - Response processing
   - Context management

3. **Storage**
